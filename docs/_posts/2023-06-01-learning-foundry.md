This is an unusual type of post, usually one creates a post after planing it out or perhaps after completing a task you intend to write about. This post (and probably more) will be different, I will write as I learn. The goal is to include my thought process and also avoid the procrastination that comes with trying to write a post after completing a task. If it works out, I will create more posts like this.

It's 4:00 AM in the morning and I've decided it's about time I learn [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). I have heard a lot of smart contract auditors and security researchers talk about it and how they use it to find bugs in smart contracts, so I thought it might be a good idea to check it out.

## [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain. It manages dependencies, project compilation, testing and deployment. It provides a solidity repl and allows interaction with chain from command-line.

### Installation

Foundry installation is straight-forward, there are several options for installing foundry, but the easiest is the following:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```
