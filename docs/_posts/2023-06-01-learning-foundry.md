## Intro

This is an unusual type of post, usually one creates a post after planing it out or perhaps after completing a task you intend to write about. This post (and probably more) will be different, I will write as I learn. The goal is to include my thought process and also avoid the procrastination that comes with trying to write a post after completing a task. If it works out, I will create more posts like this.
